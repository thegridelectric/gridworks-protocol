Hardware Layout
================

 The SCADA must be
able to deal with and process a wide variety of heating system arrangements. This is done in a Hardware Layout,
which among other things organizes relevant physical devices in the heating system (thermal stores, circulator pumps, the
heat pump, resistive heating elements, relays for heating elements). The primary objects in the Hardware Layout
are space heat nodes, although the Hardware Layout also organizes and captures information about the specific
hardware getting used (i.e. a serial number for a component, as well as its make/model).

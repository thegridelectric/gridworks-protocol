  "description": "Real-time power of TerminalAsset in Watts.. Used by a SCADA -> Atn or Atn -> AggregatedTNode to report real-time power of their TerminalAsset. Positive number means WITHDRAWAL from the grid - so generating electricity creates a negative number. This message is considered worse than useless to send after the first attempt, and does not require an ack. Shares the same purpose as gs.pwr, but comes with extra meta data. The idea is this message, instantaneous reporting of power, is the highest priority message in the system and thus gets to have its metadata made explicit in the structure of the code instead of parameterized. One result is the size of the sent data is very small. Sometimes bandwidth can be an issue, and smaller messages are very useful.",

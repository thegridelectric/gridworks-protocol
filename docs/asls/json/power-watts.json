  "description": "Real-time power of TerminalAsset in Watts. Used by a SCADA -> Atn or Atn -> AggregatedTNode to report real-time power of their TerminalAsset. Positive number means WITHDRAWAL from the grid - so generating electricity creates a negative number. This message is considered worse than useless to send after the first attempt, and does not require an ack. Shares the same purpose as gs.pwr, but is not designed to minimize bytes so comes in JSON format.",

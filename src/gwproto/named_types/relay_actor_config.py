    Relay Actor Config.

    Used to associate individual relays on a multi-channel relay board to specific SpaceheatNode
    actors. Each actor managed by the Spaceheat SCADA has an associated SpaceheatNode. That
    Node will be associated to a relay board component with multiple relays. Th relay board
    will have a list of relay actor configs so that the actor can identify which relay it has
    purview over. Has DeEnergizedState and EnergizedState

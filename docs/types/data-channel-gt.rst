**Name**:
    - Description: Name.The Channel Name is meant to be the local unique identifier for the channel within the context of a specific TerminalAsset. In addition to local uniqueness, it is immutable. It is designed to be the key that time series data is sorted by in analysis, as well as a useful way of referencing a channel within Scada code.
    - Format: SpaceheatName

**DisplayName**:
    - Description: Display Name.This display name is the handle for the data channel. It is meant to be set by the person/people who will be analyzing time series data. It is only expected to be unique within the data channels associated to a specific Terminal Asset.  Mutable.

**AboutNodeName**:
    - Description: About Name.The name of the SpaceheatNode whose physical quantities are getting captured.
    - Format: SpaceheatName

**CapturedByNodeName**:
    - Description: Captured By Name.The name of the SpaceheatNode that is capturing the physical quantities (which can be AboutName but does not have to be).
    - Format: SpaceheatName

**TelemetryName**:
    - Description: Telemetry Name.The name of the physical quantity getting measured.

**TerminalAssetAlias**:
    - Description: Terminal Asset.The Terminal Asset GNode for which this data channel is reporting data. For example, the GNode with alias hw1.isone.me.versant.keene.beech.ta represents the heat pump thermal storage system in the first GridWorks Millinocket deployment.
    - Format: LeftRightDot

**InPowerMetering**:
    - Description: In Power Metering.This channel is in the sum of the aggregate transactive power metering for the terminal asset

**StartS**:
    - Description: Start Seconds Epoch Time.The epoch time of the first data record associated to a channel. If this value is None it means no known data yet.
    - Format: ReasonableUnixTimeS

**Id**:
    - Description: Id.Meant to be an immutable identifier that is globally unique (i.e., across terminal assets).
    - Format: UuidCanonicalTextual

**TypeName**:
    - Description: All GridWorks Versioned Types have a fixed TypeName, which is a string of lowercase alphanumeric words separated by periods, most significant word (on the left) starting with an alphabet character, and final word NOT all Hindu-Arabic numerals.

**Version**:
    - Description: All GridWorks Versioned Types have a fixed version, which is a string of three Hindu-Arabic numerals.

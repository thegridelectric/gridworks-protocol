        way with respect to the APIs it presents on the Local Area Network. The Hubitat C7 is
        a home automation hub that supports building ZigBee and ZWave meshes, plugs into Ethernet,
        has a reasonable user interface and has an active community of open-source developers
        who create drivers and package managers for devices, and supports the creation of various
        types of APIs on the Local Area Network. [More Info](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AqAU_lC2phzuI9XRYvogiIYA7GXNtlr6).
      - GridWorks__Tank_Module_1: This refers to a small module designed and assembled
        by GridWorks that is meant to be mounted to the side of a hot water tank. It requires

        temperature as a function of voltage and (2) one of its potential free outputs being
        in-line with the power of a partner Fibaro, so that it can power cycle its partner (because
        there are reports of Fibaros no longer reporting temp change after weeks or months until
        power cylced). The Fibaro itself is a tiny (29 X 18 X 13 mm) Z-Wave device powered on
        9-30V DC that can read up to 6 1-wire DS18B20 temp sensors, 2 0-10V analog inputs and

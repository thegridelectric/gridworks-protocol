Instead, it just makes sure it is receiving a ChangeRelayPin command from one of its known relays.",

Associated values are CloseRelay and OpenRelay - so it is meant to be a layer up in abstraction from sending energization/de-energization commands to the pin. The sender indeed does not need to know whether the relay is normally open or normally closed (although obviously the receiver must know).",

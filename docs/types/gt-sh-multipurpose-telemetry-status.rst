**AboutNodeAlias**:
    - Description: AboutNodeAlias. The SpaceheatNode representing the physical object that the sensor reading is collecting data about. For example, a multipurpose temp sensor that reads 12 temperatures would have data for 12 different AboutNodeAliases, including say `a.tank1.temp1` for a temp sensor at the top of a water tank.
    - Format: LeftRightDot

**SensorNodeAlias**:
    - Description: SensorNodeAlias. The alias of the SpaceheatNode representing the telemetry device

        dictionary with key-value pairs that follow the requirements for an instance of the
        power.watts.000 type. Unlike the standard python dict method,
        it makes the following substantive changes:

        sent in messages.
        - Removes any key-value pairs where the value is None for a clearer message, especially

        objects, while the actual power.watts.000 object is the serialized UTF-8 byte
        string designed for sending in a message.

        This method calls the as_dict() method, which differs from the native python dict()
        in the following key ways:
        - Enum Values: Translates between the values used locally by the actor to the symbol

        Its near-inverse is PowerWatts.type_to_tuple(). If the type (or any sub-types)
        includes an enum, then the type_to_tuple will map an unrecognized symbol to the
        default enum value. This is why these two methods are only 'near' inverses.
